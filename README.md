# Processing
[View project here](http://yon.ddns.net/OTHR/processing/) (hosted partially via Github pages, partially by me)

A repo for all my [processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5](https://p5js.org/) sketches

Credit for inspiration *for probably the vast majority of these* goes to [Daniel Shiffman's "The Coding Train"](http://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/)
